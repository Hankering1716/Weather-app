Hello. By this app you can check the weather for your own city/village.

To make my app work you need to generate your own api key. Here you can find guidee. 

> https://locationweather.io/docs/docs/get-openweathermap-api-key/#:~:text=API%20Key%20Registration%201%201.%20Go%20to%20home.openweathermap.org%2Fusers%2Fsign_up,home.openweathermap.org%2Fapi_keys%205%205.%20API%20Key%20Example%20%E2%86%92%203f95891ff71036d0fe76ebadf93bfr22c15r

and then in 1.js edit the line of code to     var apiKey = "APIKEY";
